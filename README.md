# GPT Engineer

- Simplicity, all computation is "resumable" and persisted to the filesystem

## Setup
- `git clone git@github.com:AntonOsika/gpt-engineer.git`
- `cd gpt-engineer`
- `pip install -e .`
  - (or: `make install && source venv/bin/activate` for a venv)

With an api key that has GPT4 access run:

- `export OPENAI_API_KEY=[your api key]`


**Run**:
- Create an empty folder. If inside the repo, you can run:
  - `cp -r projects/example/ projects/my-new-project`
- Fill in the `main_prompt` file in your new folder
- Run: `gpt-engineer projects/my-new-project`

**Results**
- Check the generated files in `projects/my-new-project/workspace`


## Features
You can specify the "identity" of the AI agent by editing the files in the `identity` folder.

Editing the identity, and evolving the `main_prompt`, is currently how you make the agent remember things between projects.

Each step in `steps.py` will have its communication history with GPT4 stored in the logs folder, and can be rerun with `scripts/rerun_edited_message_logs.py`.

## Contributing
We are building the open platform for devs to tinker with and build their personal code-generation toolbox.
